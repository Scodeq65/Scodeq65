## 👨‍💻 About Me  

Hi there! 👋 My name is **Sodiq Agbaraojo**, a passionate **Software Engineer** and **Backend Developer** dedicated to solving real-world problems with technology.  

### 🎯 **How I Started My Coding Journey**
I had **zero programming experience** before enrolling in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. At best, I only had **basic knowledge of HTML**, and that was it.  

My journey into software engineering began with a **dream to build a school management system**. I even wrote my idea down and **pitched it to an investor**—he loved it! Unfortunately, the project never materialized. Not giving up, I approached a **web developer** to build it for me, but his quote was beyond my budget.  

For a while, the dream felt distant... until one day, a friend posted on Instagram about his **enrollment in the ALX SE program**. That post changed everything. I immediately **applied**, got in, and started my journey in **November 2022**.  

🚀 **Fast forward to February 13, 2025, I am now a certified software engineer!**  
💡 The journey was anything but easy—filled with **challenges, sleepless nights, and emotional struggles**—but **I persevered**. Today, I proudly **write my own software, solve problems, and contribute to real-world projects**.
